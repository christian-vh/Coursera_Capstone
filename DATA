   Detail: 
          This dataset contains the information of colleges, and belongs to the U.S. Department of Education.
   Description of usage: 
          This dataset will be used to get information about location, tuition fees, amount of undergrad students 
          and name of universities registered in the U.S. Department of Education.
          First, tuition fees information will be used to cluster the universities in ranges of USD 10,000.00.
          Then, the information about the number of undergrad students will be stored to be aware of the quantity 
          of students that walks around each university.
          Finally, the location data will be used to ask Foursquare API about venues around each university.
