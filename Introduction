INTRODUCTION

When an investor wants to increase his store chain, he selects a location according to several characteristics 
that will guarantee the success of his investment.  
In the specific case of an investor whose target customers are college students, there are three main characteristics for a location: 

  	1. The quantity of students that surround the area, as potential customers
	2. An approximation of the economic status of students to check if they would pay premium services or products. 
	3. The kind of venues that are most common around each university.

The characteristics mentioned above give each investor a better approach if a certain location has the appropriate 
rate of potential customers (college students around the location), if the customers are tempted to pay premium services
or products that will be offered (approximate economic status) and if the customers will accept the kind of services 
that the investor will offer (most common venues).
